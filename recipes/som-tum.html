        <p>Papaya salad is not only a signature dish in Thailand but also a popular one in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, though the Thai version is certainly the most famous. Food historians believe the dish originated in Thailand’s northeast neighbor of Laos, which might be why green papaya salad is one of the most popular dishes in Isaan, the northeastern region of the country. As the largest region in Thailand, many of the most remarkable of dishes commenced their journey into the foodie scene from this rarely visited area.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>1 cup roasted peanuts , unsalted</li>
            <li>20 snake beans , cut in 5cm/2″ pieces (raw, Note 4)</li>
            <li>3 cups grape tomato , cut in half (~400g / 14oz)</li>
            <li>▢500g / 4 cups green papaya , shredded, TIGHTLY packed cups (~1 medium, 2/3 large, Note 5)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Thai basil leaves (Note 6)</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Crush peanuts: Place peanuts in a mortar and pestle. Pound lightly to break them up into largish pieces, not into powder. Transfer to bowl.</li>
            <li>Garlic and chilli paste: Place garlic and chilli in the mortar. Pound into a paste. Add shrimp and pound to crush them – no need to grind them to a paste.</li>
            <li>Dressing: Stir in palm sugar, lime and fish sauce until sugar dissolves. Pour Dressing into a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Bruise snake beans: Add snake beans to mortar (in batches if needed). Pound to bruise, split and soften (they are raw, so they need to be bashed to soften). Add to Dressing.</li>
            <li>Crush tomato: Grab handfuls of tomato, crush with your hands then add into the bowl.</li>
            <li>Add papaya: Add papaya and 3/4 of the peanuts. Toss well with 2 wooden spoons or tongs.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately (Note 7): Once everything is coated in Dressing, immediately pile up onto plates. Spoon over some dressing (there will be a bit of dressing still left in the bowl, that's normal). Garnish with Thai basil leaves, sprinkle with remaining peanuts. Serve immediately (Note 7).</li>
